  * 1. Decide to use Flask/Postgres SQL/Bootstrap for the project
  * 2. The project is to build a productivity tool with working session timer, to-do list, calendar
  * 3. Will use goolge calendar API for the calendar part and also exchange data from the calendar to other parts of the app

  * 6. 08/20 will be focusing on product/features desgin


* 20/08/20:
  Feature design:
  * Main features: Calendar, to-do list/project management and working sessions
  * Third party log-in/Google account log-in
  * Calendar will be mainly based on Google calendar API, calendar events/to-do could be exported to to-do sections and also could be CRUD from to-do functions and working session functions
  * To-do list/project management could group and categorize to-do items to form a project. Need to highlight current to-do items
  * Working session could be allocated to different to-do items or projects to track time spent on the item/project
